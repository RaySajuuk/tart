Thus, one of our goals became to simplify accessing the compute resources in a cluster through a centralized controller host.</p>\n<p>This effort resulted in commands like <code>orchard port-forward</code> and <code>orchard ssh</code>, which were later improved to support connecting not just to the VMs, but to the worker machines themselves.</p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019re making an even further step in this effort: with a trivial configuration, an Orchard controller can act as an SSH jump host to allow connecting to the VMs using just the <code>ssh</code> command like <code>ssh -J &lt;service account name&gt;@orchard-controller.example.com &lt;VM name&gt;</code>!</p>", "image": "https://tart.run/assets/images/social/blog/posts/2024-06-20-jumping-through-the-hoops.png", "date_modified": "2024-06-20T22:39:41+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "edigaryev"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://tart.run/blog/2023/02/11/changing-tart-license/", "url": "https://tart.run/blog/2023/02/11/changing-tart-license/", "title": "Changing Tart License", "content_html": "<h1>Changing Tart License</h1>\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> We are transitioning Tart's licensing from AGPL-3.0 to <a href=\"https://fair.io/\">Fair Source 100</a>.

However, one of the challenges of contributing to Tart is that the skill set required for a contribution\nis vastly different from the skill set typically possessed by regular Tart users in their daily work. Specifically,\na contributor needs to have knowledge of the Swift programming language, as well as a background in operating systems\nand network stack. This is the reason why <strong>98.8% of the code and all the major features were contributed by Cirrus Labs engineers.</strong></p>", "image": "https://tart.run/assets/images/social/blog/posts/2023-02-11-changing-tart-license.png", "date_modified": "2024-02-23T15:27:30+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "fkorotkov"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://tart.run/blog/2023/11/03/new-dashboard-with-insights-into-performance-of-cirrus-runners/", "url": "https://tart.run/blog/2023/11/03/new-dashboard-with-insights-into-performance-of-cirrus-runners/", "title": "New dashboard with insights into performance of Cirrus Runners", "content_html": "<h1>New dashboard with insights into performance of Cirrus Runners</h1>\n<p>This month we are celebrating one year since launching Cirrus Runners \u2014 managed Apple Silicon infrastructure for your\nGitHub Actions. During the last 12 months we ran millions of workflows for our customers and now ready to share some insights\ninto price performance of them for our customers.</p>\n<p>One of the key difference with Cirrus Runners is how they are getting billed for. Customers purchase Cirrus Runners via monthly subscription\nthat costs $150 per each Cirrus Runner. Each runner can be used 24 hours a day 7 days a week to run GitHub Actions workflows\nfor an organization. If there are more outstanding jobs than available runners then they are queued and executed as soon as\nthere is a free runner. This is different from how GitHub-managed GitHub Actions are billed for \u2014 you pay for each minute of execution time.</p>\n<p>The benefit of a fixed price is that you can run as many jobs as you want without worrying about the cost. The downside is that\nyou need to make sure that you are using your runners efficiently.
